"""Daily Pipeline — orchestrates all data fetching, scoring, and signal generation.

Pipeline phases (designed for sequential execution, ~30-45 min total):

  Phase 1:   Data ingestion (universe, prices, fundamentals, macro, news)
  Phase 1.5: Energy data (EIA + infrastructure)
  Phase 2:   Scoring (technical, fundamental, macro regime)
  Phase 2.05: Economic dashboard (FRED indicators + heat index)
  Phase 2.1: TA gate (filter symbols for expensive Phase 2.5+ modules)
  Phase 2.3: Core alpha modules (smart money, variant, worldview, research, alt data)
  Phase 2.5: Extended alpha (sector experts, foreign intel, news displacement)
  Phase 2.55: Estimate revision momentum
  Phase 2.6: AI regulatory intelligence
  Phase 2.7: Deal-based modules (pairs trading, M&A, insider, energy intel)
  Phase 2.75: Pattern & options intelligence
  Phase 2.85: Alt Alpha II (earnings NLP, gov intel, labor, supply chain, digital, pharma)
  Phase 2.9: Consensus blindspots (reads ALL other module outputs)
  Phase 3:   Convergence engine + signal generation
  Phase 3.56: Cross-asset screener (stocks + commodities + crypto fat pitches)
  Phase 3.57: Narrative engine (12 macro narratives)
  Phase 3.58: Signal IC backtester (Spearman IC per module × horizon × regime)
  Phase 3.5: Devil's advocate (bear cases for HIGH conviction)
  Phase 4:   Alerts

Usage:
  python -m tools.daily_pipeline          # run full pipeline locally
  modal run modal_app.py::daily_pipeline  # run on Modal
